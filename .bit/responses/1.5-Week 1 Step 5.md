## Week 1 Step 5

### Setting up the Emotion Reader Function

Create **a new HTTP trigger function** in your Azure portal along with the Function App. Navigate to your Function App. **This is not the function code, but the actual app service resource**. 

We will be using the `parse-multipart`  and `node-fetch` npm packages.

<summary>:question: Why do we need these "packages" and what are they?</summary>
  </br>

Before the Azure Function can run the code we will write, we have to install all the necessary package dependencies. These packages contain **code that we will "depend on" in the application**; we have to install them in the console using `npm install`.

**:pencil: Task 5: Make sure you've created a new Function App and installed `parse-multipart` and `node-fetch`.**

In the left tab, scroll down to **Console**.

Enter these commands in order:

```sh
npm init -y 

npm install parse-multipart

npm install node-fetch
```
<details>
<summary>:exclamation: Woah! What just happened when they were installed?</summary>
  </br>

The first command created a **package.json** file to store your dependencies and essentially keeps track of what packages your application needs. The next two actually install the necessary packages with code, `parse-multipart` and `node-fetch`.

*Note: If you get red text like `WARN`, you can ignore it.*

</details>

**:camping: To move on, place the function URL of your new HTTP Trigger as a repository secret named `FUNCTION_URL`. Then, commit your `package.json` file to the root directory of the `week1` branch.**

*Remember: we check to see if you've placed your secrets everytime you commit!*
